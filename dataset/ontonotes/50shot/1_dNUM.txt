It O
makes O
for O
an O
amusing O
contrast O
with O
her O
grandmother O

who O

In O
my O
early O
years O

I O
always O
believed O
that O
by O
relying O
on O
my O
smarts O
and O
effort O
I O
should O
eventually O
be O
able O
to O
live O
a O
pretty O
good O
life O
, O
but O
I O
never O
thought O
that O
when O
I O
was O
28 O
I O
'd O
be O
living O
in O
a O
fine O
home O
, O
be O
driving O

have O
so O
many O
investors O
in O
my O
company O
, O
and O
have O
more O
than O
a O

We O
have O
provisions O
to O
bring O
back O
the O
entire O
seven O

crew O
of O
Discovery B-PRODUCT
if O
required O
in O
an O
emergency O

We O
are O
expecting O
some O
15,000 O
people O
to O
greet O
the B-PRODUCT

This O

Nevertheless O
many O
people O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O

of O
the O
English B-LANGUAGE

So O
we O

have O

the O

she O

The O
current O

very O
different O
