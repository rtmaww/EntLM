" O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O
study O

required O

if O
it O

found O
that O

was O
needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B-ORG

. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

by O
EU O

to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

from O
the O

food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler B-PER
proposed O
EU-wide O
measures O
after O
reports O
from O

France B-LOC
that O
under O

But O
Fischler B-PER
agreed O

review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU B-ORG

standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O

, O
questioned O
if O
such O

there O
was O
only O
a O

" O
he O

" O
Long O
dated O

it O

over-the-counter O
00-year O

it O

be O

next O
Tuesday O

He O
said O
the O
absence O

of O
many O
market O
makers O
was O
a O
main O
factor O
behind O

this O
week O
in O

in O
high-yielding O
markets O
such O
as O
Italy B-LOC
, O
Spain B-LOC

Sweden B-LOC
. O

Coughlan B-PER
said O
the O
market O
had O
more O
downside O

potential O
, O
but O
a O
fall O
was O
not O
likely O
to O

size O

" O
I O

sell O

a O

in O
Germany B-LOC

France B-LOC

" O
With O

Italy B-LOC

be O
a O

more O
vulnerable O

I O
would O

sell O

Both O

They O
put O
forward O
no O

seized O
on O
a O
comment O
by O

paedophile O
porn O

tapes O
had O
been O
seized O
, O
some O
of O

featured O

Dutroux O
was O
charged O
a O

after O

rescued O
two O

Just O
a O

later O
the O
national O
euphoria O
at O
the O
rescue O
turned O
to O
disgust O
as O
Dutroux O
led O
police O
to O
the O
bodies O
of O
two O
eight-year-old O
girls O
in O
another O
of O
his O

Julie B-PER

, O
had O
been O

Dutroux O
said O
they O
starved O

death O
nine O

also O
admitted O

a O

The O
fate O
of O
the O
girls O
is O
unknown O

but O
there O
has O
been O
speculation O
they O
were O
sold O

in O

although O
a O

said O
no O

At O

part O
of O
the O
speculation O
in O
the O
Belgian O
media O
of O
high-level O
protection O
for O
Dutroux O

on O

degree O
of O

Among O
the O
revelations O

the O
fact O
that O

running O

operation O

when O
both O
Julie B-PER

Melissa B-PER

An O

Eefje B-PER

They O
show O
that O
the O
gendarmes O
were O
aware O
that O
Dutroux O
was O
building O
cells O
in O
some O
of O
his O
houses O
for O
holding O

this O
information O
was O
either O
not O
passed O

forces O
searching O
for O
the O
missing O

or O
was O
overlooked O
when O
it O
was O

They O
also O
show O
that O

investigating O
a O
theft O
visited O
Dutroux O
late O
last O
year O
at O
the O
house O
where O
Julie B-PER
and O
Melissa B-PER
were O
being O
held O
but O
accepted O
his O
word O
that O
the O
children O

they O

kick O
. O

The O
maul O
was O
there O
and O
I O
was O
going O
to O
go O

the O
ball O

When O
( O

Justin B-PER

I O
emptied O

I O
just O
hit O
through O

one O

It O

was O
there O

Human O

lawyer O
Brian B-PER
Currin I-PER
said O
the O
hearings O
last O

were O
not O
intended O
as O
a O
form O
of O
confessional O
and O
that O
those O
who O
personally O
committed O
crimes O
during O
apartheid O
would O
testify O
only O
before O
a O
separate O
arm O
of O
the O

, O
the O

committee O
. O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
one O
should O
have O
expected O
more O
than O
what O
one O
got O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O

That O
was O
not O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
where O
perpetrators O
are O
expected O
to O
open O
their O
hearts O
and O
souls O
and O
to O
tell O
it O
all O

" O

The O
commission O
, O
which O
has O
the O
power O
to O
grant O
amnesty O
to O
those O
who O
confess O
to O
abuses O
, O
has O
begun O
hearing O
the O
testimony O
from O
people O
already O
in O
jail O
for O
their O
deeds O
. O

But O
others O
, O
such O
as O
self-confessed O
secret O
police O

leader O
Dirk B-PER
Coetzee I-PER
, O
have O
yet O
to O
testify O
. O

Tutu B-PER

deputy O
chairman O
, O
Alex B-PER
Boraine O
, O
told O
reporters O
the O
commission O
would O
begin O
issuing O
subpoenas O
to O
suspects O
who O
refused O
to O
appear O
voluntarily O
some O
time O
this O
week O
. O

He O
added O
that O
former O
hardline O
apartheid O
president O
P.W. O
Botha B-PER
could O
be O
among O
those O
called O
. O

But O
Currin B-PER
, O
who O
is O
advising O
several O
people O
regarded O
as O
perpetrators O
, O
said O
this O
was O
not O
the O
best O
way O
to O
achieve O
the O
commission O
's O
aims O
. O

" O
A O
person O
can O
be O
forced O
to O
appear O
, O
but O
the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
truth O
in O
its O
totality O
is O
if O
people O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
to O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
" O

He O
cited O
Coetzee B-PER
, O
who O
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
after O
confessing O
in O

interviews O
to O
dirty O
tricks O
. O

His O
trial O
is O
due O
to O
start O
in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin B-PER
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O
approached O
the O

left O
many O

Boraine O
said O
the O
picture O
was O
incomplete O
because O
officers O
of O
the O
apartheid-era O
security O
forces O
had O
yet O
to O
make O
their O
scheduled O
, O
separate O
submission O
, O
but O
one O
black O
caller O
to O
a O

declared O
: O

" O
This O
whole O
thing O
is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
us O
at O
all O

What O
the O

expect O
is O
to O

to O
have O

" O

Political O

said O
he O
doubted O
that O
the O

, O
which O
implemented O
apartheid O
in O

and O
began O
dismantling O
it O
in O

, O
felt O
it O
carried O
a O
burden O
of O
guilt O
and O
needed O
to O
be O
exculpated O
through O
the O
commission O
. O

" O
Therefore O
I O
have O
some O
doubts O
about O
achieving O
some O
form O
of O
reconciliation O

One O
has O
to O
feel O
a O

As O
a O

with O

of O

Critics O
say O
that O
what O
was O
billed O
as O
an O
electoral O
process O
to O
reintegrate O
Bosnia O
as O
a O
single O
, O
multi-ethnic O

" O

in O

according O
to O
a O

What O
it O
comes O
down O
to O
is O
this O
: O
If O
you O
're O
highly O
skilled O
, O
you O
'll O
benefit O
nicely O

But O
if O

for O

if O
an O

" O
she O
said O

In O

After O

Now O

says O

place O
a O
greater O
emphasis O
on O

In O
a O
break O
from O

the O
Open O
did O
not O
seed O
in O
strict O

instead O
taking O
into O

One O

outrage O
at O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. O

has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O
, O
has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. O
Open O
in O
the O
players O
' O
mind O
, O
and O
we O

that O
is O
damaging O

" O
Martin B-PER

Stich B-PER
said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O

to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O

lingers O
in O

mind O
that O

they O
forget O
about O
all O

who O
lost O
the O

Andre B-PER

It O
was O
Agassi B-PER
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O

The O
flamboyant O
American O

bumped O
up O
two O

his O

of O
eight O

a O

of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O

should O
be O

the O
way O

is O
playing O

right O
now O

the O
unfairness O

Stich B-PER
, O
not O
seeded O

for O
the O

might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O

seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov O
withdrew O

Ranked O
00th O

insistence O
that O

part O

a O

, O
Lebed B-PER
managed O
to O
arrange O
an O
ambitious O
ceasefire O
in O
the O

last O
week O
, O
days O
after O
the O
Russian B-MISC
army O
threatened O
to O
bomb O
its O
way O
back O

the O

He O
returned O

conclude O
a O
political O
settlement O
that O
would O
make O
this O

work O
where O
all O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O

he O
needed O
to O
tidy O
up O
legal O
loose O

also O
cover O

he O

, O

, O
could O
meet O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
if O
the O
start O

would O

sent O
back O

It O
is O
not O
known O
what O
caused O
the O
delay O
in O
the O
peace O
plan O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed B-PER
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya B-LOC
as O
Yeltsin O
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin O
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed B-PER
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PER
Maskhadov O
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin O
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed B-PER
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
. O

Lebed B-PER
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov O
warned O
that O
Lebed B-PER
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian B-MISC
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens B-MISC
say O
-- O
Russian B-MISC
forces O
. O

Maskhadov O
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed B-PER
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin O
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin O
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya B-LOC
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
-- O
something O
Moscow B-LOC
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North O
Caucasus O
. O

Lebed B-PER
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O
war O

" O

" O
Sitanyi O

that O
several O

, O
has O
kept O
a O
low O

that O
the O

suffered O
last O

be O
taking O

WASHINGTON B-LOC

The B-ORG
Securities I-ORG
and I-ORG
Exchange I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
Wednesday I-ORG
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
so-called O
order O
handling O
rules O
, O
which O
were O
proposed O
last O
September O
, O
were O
approved O
in O
a O
0-0 O
vote O
. O

The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq B-MISC
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O
readily O
available O
to O
them O
. O

The O
rules O
will O
also O
require O
that O
customer O
limit O
orders O
be O
displayed O
with O
prices O
better O
than O
those O
available O
in O
quotes O
publicly O
available O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
are O
companies O
or O
individuals O
recognised O
as O
qualified O
to O
maintain O
an O
orderly O
market O
in O
a O
stock O
. O

In O
a O
limit O
order O
, O
investors O
specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
market O
order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O
prices O
. O

" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
, O
" O
said O
SEC O
Chairman O
Arthur B-PER
Levitt I-PER
. O

The O
SEC O
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

The O
director O
of O
the O
SEC O
's O
division O
of O
market O
regulation O
, O
Richard B-PER
Lindsey I-PER
, O
said O
Wall O
Street O
firms O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
spend O
about O
$ O
0 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC O
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

Earlier O
this O
month O
, O
the O
SEC O
settled O
charges O
of O
alleged O
malpractices O
on O
Nasdaq B-MISC
when O
the O
parent O
of O
the O
Nasdaq B-MISC
market O
, O
the O
National B-ORG
Association I-ORG

Securities I-ORG

, O
agreed O
to O
spend O
$ O
000 O
million O
over O
five O
years O
to O
upgrade O
its O
oversight O
of O
brokers O
' O
trading O
practices O
. O

The O
SEC O
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O
investors O
with O
market O
orders O
to O
trade O
at O
a O
better O
price O
if O
there O
were O
shifts O
in O
prices O
before O
their O
orders O
were O
executed O
. O

The O
agency O
said O
it O
would O
monitor O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
new O
rules O
before O
considering O
the O
" O
price O
improvement O
" O
proposal O
again O
. O

The O
agency O
also O
proposed O
rule O
changes O
that O
would O
require O
continuous O
" O
bid O
" O
and O
" O
ask O
" O
quotations O
from O
exchange O
specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
who O
trade O
more O
than O
0 O
percent O
of O
a O
stock O
during O
any O
quarter O
on O
Nasdaq B-MISC
. O

The O
SEC O
's O
limit O

rule O
will O
mean O
a O
major O
change O
for O

, O
where O

Andrei B-PER
Medvedev I-PER
exchanged O
his O
reputation O
as O
the O
clown O
prince O
of O

on O

for O
a O
new O
no-nonsense O
attitude O
that O

" O
I O

in O
the O

It O
was O
Medvedev B-PER

sixth O

in O
a O

after O
winning O
his O
first O
tournament O
of O
the O
year O
last O
week O
at O
the O
Hamlet B-PER
Cup O
. O

" O
I O
realised O
this O
year O
, O
that O
without O
putting O
00.0 O
percent O
of O
your O
mind O
into O
tennis O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
successful O
, O
" O
said O
the O
00-year-old O
Medvedev B-PER
. O

" O
The O
whole O
day O
I O
'm O
thinking O
abnout O
tennis O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O
things O
I O
was O
doing O
the O
years O
before O

they O
were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O
helping O
me O
at O
all O
. O
" O

For O
Medvedev B-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O
peripheral O

such O
as O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O
food O
in O

an O

that O
took O
his O

off O

. O

" O
I O
know O
what O
I O

here O

said O
Medvedev B-PER

who O
lost O
in O

round O
of O
the O

the O
last O
two O
years O
after O
reaching O
the O

the O

tried O
his O

as O
a O
restaurant O
critic O

" O
I O

I O
have O
much O
more O
fun O
on O

, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Just O
three O
years O
ago O
Medvedev B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French O
Open O
semifinal O
and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

But O
Medvedev B-PER
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O
Ukrainian O
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
00th O
two O
months O

. O

" O
It O
's O
somewhere O
where O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev B-PER
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
00 O
. O
" O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O
the O
penalty O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
" O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O
approach O
, O
Medvedev B-PER
hired O
Australian O
coach O
Bob B-PER
Brett I-PER
at O
the O
start O
of O
this O
year O
and O
the O
partnership O
is O
beginning O
to O

off O

" O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
we O
started O
from O
zero O
, O
" O
said O
Medvedev B-PER
. O
" O

Winning B-PER
in O
Long O
Island O
( O

the O
first O

" O

While O
Medvedev B-PER
's O
00-minute O
romp O
past O
Fleurian O
was O
rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O
were O
playing O
each O
other O
was O
rather O
remarkable O
. O

In O
the O
original O
draw O
, O
Medvedev B-PER
and O
Fleurian O
were O
slotted O
to O
play O
each O
other O
. O

When O

forced O
the O

done O
over O

against O
odds O
of O

-- O
Medvedev B-PER

Fleurian O
drew O
each O
other O
a O
second O
time O

" O
When O
I O
saw O
the O

I O
did O

have O
to O
change O
my O
preparation O
, O
" O

Basuki B-PER

a O

" O

The B-ORG
European I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
would O
study O
scientific O
reports O
saying O
Britain B-LOC
's O
mad O
cow O
epidemic O
would O
die O
out O
by O
0000 O
but O
offered O
little O
prospect O
the O
findings O
would O
change O
an O
agreed O
slaughter O
campaign O
. O

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O
. O

We O
will O
ask O
the O
( O
EU B-ORG
) O
scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission B-ORG
spokesman O
Gerard B-PER
Kiely I-PER
told O
Reuters B-ORG
. O

But O
he O
added O
that O
new O
research O
into O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE O
) O
, O
a O
fatal O
brain-wasting O
disease O
suffered O
by O
cattle O
, O
was O
unlikely O
to O
alter O
a O
slaughter O
plan O
agreed O
by O
Britain B-LOC
and O
its O
00 O
EU B-ORG
partners O
. O

" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O
detailed O
scientific O
analysis O
using O
a O
methodology O
which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
BSE O
cases O
possible O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O
BSE O
cases O
, O
" O
Kiely B-PER
said O
. O

" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O
plan O
) O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O
with O
the O
number O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O
question O
of O
numbers O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
that O
's O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O
consumers O
' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British O
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature B-ORG
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
0000 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O
cattle O
. O

The O
researchers O
predicted O
there O
would O
be O
000 O
new O
infections O
and O
00,000 O
new O
cases O
of O
BSE O
before O
0000 O
. O

British O
farmers O
' O
leader O
called O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
an O
urgent O
meeting O
with O
ministers O
to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O

" O
I O
hope O
the O
government O
will O
now O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
a O
better O
way O

dealing O
with O
this O
issue O
, O
" O
National B-ORG

president O
Sir O
David B-PER
Naish I-PER
told O
BBC O

. O

Naish B-PER
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
Britain B-LOC
to O
carry O
out O
a O
planned O
cull O
of O
some O
000,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European O
partners O
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O
animals O
being O
culled O
if O
in O
fact O
scientists O
throughout O
Europe B-LOC
accepted O
this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish B-PER
said O
. O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O
Britain B-LOC

the O
EU B-ORG
, O
which O
slapped O

LONDON B-LOC
0000-00-00 O

The O
chairman O
of O
British-based O
components O
and O
engineering O
group O
T&N O
Plc O
said O
on O
Thursday O
the O
firm O
remained O
confident O
about O
the O
general O
prospects O
for O
its O
operating O
margins O
despite O
pressure O
from O
unsettled O
markets O
. O

In O
an O
interview O
following O
its O
first-half O
results O
, O
which O
included O
a O
less O
optimistic O
forecast O
for O
the O
second O
half O
of O
this O
year O
than O
it O
had O
made O
in O
the O
past O
, O
Sir O
Colin B-PER
Hope O
said O
T&N O
had O
taken O
defensive O
action O
to O
protect O
it O
from O
patchy O
markets O
. O

Looking O
at O
market O
prospects O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O
at O
this O
stage O
is O
that O
it O
will O
probably O
bumble O
along O
in O
the O
rather O
mixed O
way O
it O
's O
been O
in O
the O
first O
half O
. O
" O

" O
It O
's O
very O
difficult O
to O
predict O
the O
market O
( O
trend O
) O
this O
year O
. O

It O
could O
be O
better O
, O
or O
it O
could O
be O
worse O
, O
" O
Hope B-PER
added O
, O
echoing O
the O
demand O
uncertainty O
across O
automotive O
industries O
. O

" O
You O
can O
see O
anxieties O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
France B-LOC
, O
in O
particular O
, O
beginning O
to O
grow O
and O
develop O
. O

America B-PER
, O
however O
, O
is O
looking O
a O
little O
better O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Compared O
with O
the O
end O
of O
last O
year O
, O
when O
T&N O
predicted O
a O
sluggish O
first O
half O
and O
a O
rebound O
later O
in O
0000 O
, O
Hope B-PER
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O
first O
half O
has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
felt O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
, O
but O
equally O
we O
're O
certainly O
not O
predicting O
a O
recovery O
in O
the O
second O
half O
. O
" O

Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope B-PER
said O
the O
group O
was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O
and O
destocked O
even O
though O
this O
had O
pressed O
margins O
, O
which O
had O
slipped O
to O
0.0 O
percent O
from O
00.0 O
percent O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
0.0 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O
southern O
African O
) O
mines O
actually O
is O
not O
bad O
. O

" O
It O
does O
show O
how O
easily O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
bounce O
back O
over O
00 O
percent O
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
continue O
to O
feel O
very O
relaxed O
about O
our O
general O
view O
that O
we O
would O
average O
00 O
percent O
profit O
margins O
over O
the O
cycle O
. O
" O

" O
We O
've O
always O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
we O
are O
the O
sort O
of O
company O
that O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
working O
in O
difficult O
circumstances O
-- O
we O
're O
rather O
used O
to O
it O
. O

And O
we O
feel O
very O
confident O
that O
we O
're O
doing O
all O
the O
right O
things O
, O
" O
Hope B-PER
said O
. O

" O
When O
the O
( O
profit O
) O
figures O
will O
bounce O
back O
up O
again O
is O
just O
a O
function O
of O

recovering O
just O
a O

, O
" O

The O
outcome O
of O
the O
November O
elections O
emerged O
as O
a O
hot O
topic O
on O
Wall O
Street O
this O
week O
as O
financial O
pundits O
debated O
whether O
Robert B-PER
Rubin I-PER
might O
forgo O
a O
second O
term O
as O
Treasury B-ORG
secretary O
if O
President O
Clinton B-PER
is O
re-elected O
. O

Concern O
centred O
on O
the O
currency O
markets O
since O
Rubin B-PER
's O
tour O
de O
force O
has O
been O
his O
unflagging O
support O
of O
the O
dollar O
. O

Speculation O
that O
Rubin B-PER
might O
not O
stay O
in O
his O
post O
grew O
after O
he O
sidestepped O
questions O
about O
any O
future O
Cabinet O
post O
during O
television O
interviews O
at O
the O
Democratic O
convention O
in O
Chicago B-LOC
this O
week O
. O

Should O
Rubin B-PER
leave O
, O
Wall O
Street O
would O
worry O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
strong-dollar O
policy O
with O
him O
. O

Rubin B-PER
's O
predecessor O
at O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
, O
Lloyd B-PER
Bentsen I-PER
, O
was O
viewed O
with O
suspicion O
by O
some O
in O
the O
financial O
markets O
who O
thought O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
push O
down O
the O
dollar O
to O
gain O
an O
edge O
in O
trade O
negotiations O
with O
Japan B-LOC
. O

" O
Obviously O
, O
under O
the O
Clinton B-PER
administration O
, O
we O
've O
seen O
two O
distinctively O
different O
dollar O
policies O
, O
" O
said O
Chris B-PER
Widness O
, O
an O
international O
economist O
at O
Chase B-ORG
Securities I-ORG
Inc. I-ORG
" O
Under O
Rubin B-PER
, O
the O
U.S. O
has O
certainly O
looked O
for O
a O
strong O
dollar O
. O
" O

That O
strategy O
, O
backed O
up O
by O
timely O
instances O
of O
joint O
central O
bank O
intervention O
, O
helped O
the O
dollar O
battle O

Rubin B-PER
was O
widely O
hailed O
as O
the O
architect O
of O
the O
dollar O
's O
comeback O
, O
using O
skills O
and O
expertise O
gained O
in O
00 O
years O
on O

, O
part O
of O

Inc B-ORG

" O
Rubin B-PER
has O
done O
a O
fine O
job O
in O
that O
position O
, O
" O
said O
Michael B-PER
Faust I-PER
, O
a O
portfolio O
manager O
at O
Bailard O
, O
Biehl B-PER
and O
Kaiser B-PER
, O
which O
manages O
just O
under O

global O
stocks O

. O

" O
Anyone O
who O
would O
come O
in O
there O
to O
replace O
him O
would O
have O
awfully O
big O
shoes O
to O
fill O
. O
" O

Fear O
that O
a O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
secretary O
might O
favour O
a O
return O
to O
Bentsen-era O
policy O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O
financial O
markets O
. O

Some O
overseas O
investors O
might O
shy O
away O
from O
buying O
U.S. O
stocks O
and O
bonds O
or O
even O
sell O
them O
when O
the O
dollar O
is O
weakening O
. O

As O
for O
U.S. O
Treasury O
securities O
, O
Widness O
explained O
that O
Alan B-PER
Greenspan I-PER
's O
reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal O
Reserve O
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O
budget O
were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin B-PER
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
. O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United O
States B-PER
, O
" O
said O
Widness O
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. O
stocks O
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-PER
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin B-PER
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O
currency O
. O

" O
If O
he O
left O

the O
first O
question O
people O
would O
ask O
the O
next O
guy O
is O
, O
' O
What O

your O

Michael B-PER
Perelstein I-PER

MainStay O
International O

. O

" O
And O
all O
I O
can O
say O
as O
a O
piece O
of O

that O
they O
